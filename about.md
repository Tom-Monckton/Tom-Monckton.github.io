# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Tom Monckton**, a Mechatronic Engineering student at the University of Queensland (UQ), currently studying **ELEC4603 – Image Processing and Computer Vision**.

This blog is where I document my learning journey through the [fast.ai course](https://www.fast.ai), along with key insights, technical challenges, and solutions I’ve explored along the way.

## 🎯 What I’m Interested In

- Machine learning and computer vision  
- Embedded systems and robotics  
- Off-grid power systems, automation, and sustainability  
- Hands-on engineering projects (boats, drones, 3D printing)

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find on This Blog

- Reflections and weekly learnings from the fast.ai course  
- Code snippets and model outputs  
- Visual experiments using PyTorch, Fastai, and OpenCV  
- Performance comparisons (CPU vs GPU, batch sizes, etc.)  
- Occasional debugging war stories from devcontainers or VSCode setups

## 📷 Outside of Engineering

Outside uni and coding, I’m into:
- Sailing and spearfishing 🐟  
- Climbing, hiking, and outdoor adventure 🧗  
- Photography and drone videography  
- Music (I play in a band 🎸)
